## Overview

Deep research systems require sophisticated capabilities beyond basic language understanding and generation. This survey focuses on post-training techniques that enhance these systems' ability to conduct research, reason about complex problems, and interact with various tools and data sources effectively.

Post-training enhancements include but are not limited to:
- Prompt engineering techniques
- Fine-tuning approaches
- Reinforcement learning approaches
